# INFOM451 Gastro

This sbt scala project was created with the intellij IDEA.

The purpose of this project is to submit some application of the scala theory lessons in the context of a fun situation asking us to produce some kind of menu creator that has to propose healthy meals.

I choosed to use another dataset found [here](http://www.afsca.be/denreesalimentaires/complementsalimentaires/_documents/2009-06-16_Circ_nouvelles_valeurs_AJR_ext-1_000.pdf) to get some guidance of what is a good meal and what's not.

### Disclaimer

Of course you should not trust to the results of this program for your real menu.
The only purpose is to write idiomatic scala, not to provide real dietary advices.
